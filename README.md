<img src="image/banner.jpg">

## Overview
This is an Online Exam System developed in PHP. It was initially created back in 2015 when I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The project was a result of my enthusiasm for programming and my desire to build something practical and useful.

## Features
- User registration and authentication system.
- Admin panel for managing exams, questions, and users.
- Timer-based exams with automatic submission.
- Randomized question order to prevent cheating.
- Detailed result analysis after the exam.

## Technologies Used
- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the database schema from `database.sql` to set up the required tables.
3. Configure the database connection in `config.php`.
4. Start a PHP server or use a web server like Apache.
5. Access the application through a web browser.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to my professors and peers who supported and encouraged me during the development of this project. It was a valuable learning experience that helped me enhance my coding and problem-solving abilities.

I also want to give credit to the creators of the "SB Admin v2.0" template, which was used for the project's admin panel. The template provided a solid foundation for the project's user interface.
